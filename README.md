 [Unischeduler](https://scheduler.oatmeal.cc) is a client-side web app that converts class schedule from text to [icalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format that can be exported into any calendar service (google calendar, apple calendar, outlook calendar, etc).

 It might seem like a tool any University would provide by default, yet Oracle PeopleSoft Campus Solutions (and any university using it) doesn't seem to do so, which is horrible for students that want to keep track of their classes using a calendar. That's why I made unischeduler.

 This version of unischeduler is the final step in its journey: It started out as a simple [python script](https://www.github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler), then became a [cross-platform qt-based desktop app](https://github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler_gui/), then a [web service](https://github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler_web/), and now it's available on the web yet entirely on the client-side, making it fast, safe, and convenient.
