 [Unischeduler](https://scheduler.oatmeal.cc) is a web client-side app that converts class schedule from text to an icalendar format to export into any known calendar service (google calendar, apple calendar, outlook calendar, etc).

 It might seem like a tool University would provide by default, yet Oracle PeopleSoft Campus Solutions (and any university using it) doesn't seem to have this functionality, which is horrible for students that want to keep track of their classes using a calendar. That's why I made unischeduler.

 This version of unischeduler is the final step in its journey: It started out as a simple [python script](https://www.github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler), then became a [cross-platform qt-based desktop app](https://github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler_gui/), then a [web service](https://github.com/Ovsyanka83/unischeduler_web/), and now it's available on the web yet entirely on the client-side, making it fast, safe, and convenient.
